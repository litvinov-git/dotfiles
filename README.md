# litvinov-git dotfiles
Basically uploaded my dotfiles not to lose them randomly due to a dead device. A lot of things are to be done for this repo:
1. Installation script that would symlink everything to ~/.config
2. Complete my scripts, probably give them their own repo
3. Complete my nvim setup, probably give it its own repo too since i like it a lot and it is very unusual, but might be helpful for many new nvim users (it uses WASD binds)
4. Upload a ton of wallpapers
5. Try dwl or sway
