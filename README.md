# litvinov-git dotfiles
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litvinov-git/dotfiles/refs/heads/main/dotfiles.png)
Basically uploaded my dotfiles to not lose them randomly due to a dead machine. A lot of things are to be done for this repo:
1. Installation script that would symlink everything to ~/.config
2. Complete my scripts, probably give them their own repo
3. Complete my nvim setup, probably give it its own repo too since i like it a lot and it is very unusual, but might be helpful for many new nvim users (it uses WASD binds)
4. Upload a ton of wallpapers
5. Try dwl or sway
6. Capture my desktop in more detail, including GTK and other things, so I (or you) can git clone it on an empty machine and get up and running in a few minutes
## About the configuration
My config is very minimal and menu scripting reliant - there is no shell or bar or any widgets whatsoever (no-no-no, not that kind shell, for that kind of shell i have my zsh). The overall theme is based around catppuccin mocha, but with many slight variations towards more contrast with the background, and some more interesting colors
